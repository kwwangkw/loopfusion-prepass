EECS 583 Research Project
Loop Fusion compiler pre pass. Constraint loosening pass - focused on intervening code movement and bound conforming, especially the identified case of "for-if-for" statement movement.
Allows for greater percentage of loop fuses to occur through LLVM compiler -loop-fusion. Full research paper provided upon request.

To run:
cd into build and run:
  cmake ..
  make -j2
cd into workfiles and run:
  clang -Xclang -disable-O0-optnone -emit-llvm -c benchmark1.c -o benchmark1.bc
  opt -load ../build/LoopFusePrePass/LLVMHW2.so -loopfuseprepass < benchmark1.bc > output.bc
  opt -loop-rotate < output.bc > temp.bc
  opt -mem2reg -loop-fusion < temp.bc > output2.bc

To visualize:
cd into workfiles and run:
  ./viz.sh output2
  
To run .bc files:
cd into workfiles and run:
  llc -filetype=obj my-file-to-run.bc
  gcc -no-pie my-file-to-run.o
  ./a.out
